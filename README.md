================
By Stephen Pangburn, Lucas Jovalis, and Matthew Luu

A media player project initially put together for a class assignment. Focus was on minimalist interface and looping functionality.

Though the project is considered feature-complete, a number of bugs and extensions have yet to be implemented, namely:

1. GUI resizing bug upon first opening, can be corrected by resizing the window, but the bug has yet to be isolated.
2. Altering playback speed of the video
3. Implementing some form of rewind functionality, along with fast forward.
4. Currently no UI in fullscreen, also current implementation slightly buggy, but functional
