amp-media-player
================

A media player project initially put together for a class assignment. Focus was on minimalist interface and looping functionality.

Though the project is considered feature-complete, a number of bugs and extensions have yet to be implemented, namely:
1. The Swing GUI experiences a resizing bug upon first opening the player, this is corrected upon resizing the window, but the bug has yet to be isolated.
2. Altering playback speed of the video
3. Implementing some form of rewind functionality, along with fast forward.
4. Currently no UI in fullscreen, also current implementation slightly buggy, but functional

Libraries Used:
Java Swing
VLCJ
Swing Range Slider Widget: https://github.com/ernieyu/Swing-range-slider
